## :clipboard: Options
In Pagantis admin panel, we can set the following options:

| Field | Description<br/><br/>
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| Module is enabled    |  - Yes => Activate the payment method <br/> - No => Disabled the payment method
| Public Key(*)        |  String you can get from your [Pagantis profile](https://bo.pagantis.com/shop).

## :clipboard: Advanced configuration:
The module has many configuration options you can set, but we recommend use it as is.

If you want to manage it, you have a way to update the values via HTTP, you only need to make a post to:

<strong>{your-domain-url}/index.php?fc=module&module=pagantis&controller=config&secret={your-secret-key}</strong>

sending in the form data the key of the config you want to change and the new value.


Here you have a complete list of configurations you can change and it's explanation.
